# To-do list use redux library with react.js
Basically, this is just a to-do list app that I made for my portfolio. And this project will display most of features of a basic to-do list application. In this application, I will use reactjs, material-UI for displaying the view, and manage states and data of all components by using redux library. 
Actually, I think, this small app doesn't need to use redux, but I use it for doing practice with my redux,react knowledge I've just learned.
